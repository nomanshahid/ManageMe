# ManageMe

A demo can be found here: [https://managemeapp.herokuapp.com](https://managemeapp.herokuapp.com/ "ManageMe")

ManageMe is a business management Rails application hosted on Heroku with PostgreSQL in the backend. Initially it was made for child care centres to simplify the way their business is managed across multiple locations. However, the application has since been generalized to work with other fitting businesses such as retirement homes, medical clinics, and others that need a simpler way to manage their growing client base.

The demo is a good starting point in understanding the foundation of the platform. The application is customized for each business that uses it so certain areas (ex. tables, reports, etc.) are different for each company.
